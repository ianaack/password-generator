# Password Generator
## A web application to generate a password based on user prompts for criteria

This JavaScript project is used to generate a random password based on user prompts.
First the user will be prompted for their desired length of password, anywhere between 8 and 128 characters.
Next, the user will be able to define what types of characters they would like to include in their password. 
They are given a choice of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical values, and special characters.
They can choose whether to include any of the character types, or not, but they must include at least one. 
If they do not, the application will reset itself, the user will be notified, and the process will start over.

The application can be found here: https://ianaack.github.io/password-generator/
